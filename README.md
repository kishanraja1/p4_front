#Technologies Used
*React (Create-React-App) - front end framework
*Material UI - majority of styling present
*Slick UI - carousel visuals
*Auth0 - user authentication
*Axios - Using our API and Spotify's API


#Approach Taken
*Styling was a continuous effort. Below are other steps we took to create this app:

*1. Use Create-React-App as a starting point for our react application
*2. Make API calls using axios
*3. Build a bare front end, where users can just create, read, update and delete from our API
*4. Build our connection with Spotify API
*5. Add an option for users to add spotify data to our API.
*6. Add authentication feature using Auth0.
*7. Finalize styling


#Unsolved Problems


#User Stories
*As a general user, one can visit our site to get music recs based on genre, artist or year
*As an authenticated user, one can edit, delete or add new music recs to the music lists.
